# Raytracing 2D Renderer

![](https://github.com/aboyobam/raytracing-2d-renderer/blob/master/preview.gif)

Written in strict typescript.

## How to run
First install all build dependencies.
```sh
npm install
```

Then you can start a webpack dev server with `npm start` or compile the code with `npm run build` \
After that, you can open the `dist/index.html` and you should see the cube rendered.

It uses no runtime dependencies and is only 3.7kb (with gzip)
